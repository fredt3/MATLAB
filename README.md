# MATLAB
MATLAB projects that I wrote in college. 


Brain Machine Interfacing directory includes sample scripts I wrote (Beginning with Run...m).
I could only find the questions for a couple of the scripts (in PDFs).
Final Project does not include .mat's. The file would be over half a gigabyte.

RC Car directory includes two .m files that contain a script that when used with a specific superheterodyne receiver,
will act as a remote for the RC Car. In this example you can use multiple commands.

Sound with MATLAB directory includes two songs and a phone dial sound that uses the note10.m file. The two song .m 
files has different notes as variables which then can be concatenated together to create a song.

Misc directory contains one file right now, a simple fibonacci script. I will add more when I find some more 
scripts from college.
